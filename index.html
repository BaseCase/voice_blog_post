        <p>This is the written version of a talk I gave at <a href="http://adorable.io">Adorable</a>. The slides I used are shown here next to what are essentially expanded speaker notes. The interactive portion of the talk doesn’t translate that well to text, but I did my best to explain the exercises.

        <p>Thanks for joining me! Today I want to talk about something that—even though we don't think about it much—affects us constantly: our voices.</p>

        <p>But first, let’s talk about the goals for this talk. I want to be clear that, though the title may suggest otherwise, this is not about public speaking or communication skills. It’s much simpler than that. I’m also not here to <em>change</em> anything about you or your voice. Quite the opposite, actually: I want to help you share your natural voice more effectively.</p>

        <p>My starting point when putting together this talk was very simple: sometimes we are not loud enough! We’ve probably all had the experience of being in a meeting—especially one involving teleconferencing software—and getting interrupted by someone saying they can’t hear us. So I want to help you become more aware of your voice and give you some tips on how to address that feedback.</p>

        <p>In this first section, I’d like to go over some background information. We probably all know this stuff at some level, but it’s worth bringing it up here so that we’re on the same page.</p>

        <p>Voices are a kind of sound, so let’s start with sound. You can think of sound as being composed of three main parts:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Vibrations</strong>, traveling through a medium such as the air.</li>
          <li><strong>Ears</strong>, receiving those vibrations and converting them into input that we can use.</li>
          <li><strong>Brains</strong>, turning that input into meaningful information.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you’re missing any of those three components, you don’t have a meaningful sound. For the physicists in the audience who now silently hate me, please not that I’m intentionally framing things in a way that makes them useful for thinking about the voice. I realize that this is not a 100% accurate view of the universe.</p>
      </div>

        <img src="img/010.png">
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>A few other tidbits about sound that we want to keep in mind while speaking:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We are a visually oriented species, so we don’t always think about the fact that sound loses fidelity much more quickly than sight. This matters especially in the case when we’re teleconferencing: get right on top of a mic and there’s no problem, but move just a few feet away and suddenly you are inaudible.</li>
          <li>Sound vibrations are changed by the media they are traveling through. You’ve probably had the experience of hearing a recording of yourself and thinking “Who the heck is that?” Your voice sounds quite a bit different to you than it does to people outside of your own skull.</li>
          <li>We can think of the sounds we produce as directional. If you want someone to hear you, you should point yourself at them. If you look down, or off to the side, or into a computer monitor, those vibrations are not going to get to their ears as effectively.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row slide">

      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>Now let’s talk more specifically about the voice.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Air Flow</strong> from your lungs is what powers the voice. No air, no voice.</li>
          <li><strong>Vocal Folds</strong> in your larynx, when set oscillating by the air from your lungs, create the vibrations needed. These are the same things as “vocal cords”, but I had it beaten into me to call them “folds” in school, so...</li>
          <li><strong>Mouth Shape</strong> (along with lips, nasal passages, soft palate, teeth, and other stuff) adjusts the harmonics from the vibrating vocal folds, which is how we have the ability to create different phonemes.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Without any of these three components, there’s no voice. In the second part of the talk, we’ll be doing exercises to improve our use of each of them.</p>
      </div>

        <p>We have a lot of conscious control over our voices. If we didn’t, spoken language would be impossible. However, there are also lots of unconscious things that happen when we speak. Many of these things are a result of us responding to perceived pressures and expectations in the world around us. We’ll dig into this a little bit in the next section, but unfortunately it’s too big of a topic to get very far into today.</p>

      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>Teleconferencing is a big part of our lives, so we should mention a few things specifically about microphones. When speaking with someone in the same room, we have a lot of extra information available to us that microphones do not. Since they don’t have brains, microphones are unable to fill in the blanks of a sentence when they don’t hear someone clearly. Since they don’t have eyes, they can’t watch lips, gestures, or facial expressions to interpret extra meaning. And without context of what’s happening around them, they can’t filter out things like the noise from an A/C unit or someone coughing.</p>

        <p>Now, obviously, that there are humans listening on the other end of the microphone mitigates these problems to some extent, but there’s still quite a bit of information lost over the wire. It’s on us to make sure our voices are heard clearly by everyone.</p>

        <p>Now for the fun part. When I gave this talk live, I was able to demonstrate the following exercises in front of everyone and then have them try it. Since I can’t do that here, I’ll do my best to explain exactly how to do them and what their purpose is.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>We’re going to do three simple exercises. Enjoy the super snappy names I came up with for them.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row slide">
      <div class="small-12 medium-4 columns">
        <img src="img/016.png">
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>The first exercise is called “Use your lungs,” and it’s all about helping you notice your breathing process.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>First, clap your hands together above your head with your arms straight up.</li>
          <li>Second, with your arms still extended up, rotate your hands so that the backs are touching.</li>
          <li>Third, gently lower your hands until they’re resting on top of your head, still together.</li>
          <li>Lastly, from this position, take several nice, slow, deep breaths in and out.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Pay close attention to the physical sensations that come up while breathing in this position. This exercise is not about <strong>making</strong> anything happen, but about <strong>noticing</strong> how your body feels when you encourage it to use your lungs in a more generous way.</p>

        <p>Once you’ve taken several breaths, lower your arms to a neutral position and take several more deep breaths, trying to notice some of the same physical sensations in your ribcage, chest, stomach, shoulders, etc.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row slide">
      <div class="small-12 medium-4 columns">
        <img src="img/017.png">
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>The reason for doing this exercise is that we have a tendency to not gas up properly before speaking. Without air, remember, your voice isn’t going anywhere, so it’s really important to make sure you’ve got enough in the tank to get your voice to your listeners. Keep these extra points in mind as well: refuel when you need to, and make sure the end of your sentence gets just as much love as the beginning.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row slide">
      <div class="small-12 medium-4 columns">
        <img src="img/018.png">
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>OK, second exercise. This one’s called “Let your voice out.”</p>

        <ol>
          <li>First, relax your jaw. This can be pretty difficult, because we tend to carry a lot of tension in our jaws, necks, and shoulders, but give it your best shot.</li>
          <li>Use your lungs. Take a nice deep breath just like you did in exercise 1.</li>
          <li>Now say “wow” several times with a nice wide mouth. Notice how much space there is in there.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The thing to notice with this exercise is how it feels to open your mouth fairly widely. A lot of us (myself included) have a tendency to keep our mouths almost closed while speaking, which means the voice can’t escape out into the room. Also, that jaw tension can interfere with the vibrations from our vocal folds, so it's helpful to become aware of where we carry tension, and try to start relaxing that.</p>

        <p>The joke I made in the live talk was "I call this exercise The Kate Bush," which played about as well as you'd expect.</p>

        <p>A few more tips for this section. Make sure that there isn't anything in between your mouth and your listeners. If you've got a hand over your mouth, that will block just as much sound as not opening your mouth wide enough.</p>

        <p>Remember that your voice sounds different in your own skull. You might not realize that you're being quiet, because to you things sound normal. But if your mouth is closed, those vibrations can't get out of your skull into the air.</p>

        <p>An easy heuristic for "am I opening my mouth wide enough": if you can't get a bit of food *in*, your voice can't get *out*.</p>

        <p>We'll start the third exercise in a moment.</p>

        <p>First, let's revisit some of the social issues around voices that I alluded to earlier. Again, I'm not trying to be exhaustive with this discussion—that's an entirely different talk—I just want to bring up these issues because they affect us not only mentally but also physically in terms of how our voices manifest.</p>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>Society has a lot of expectations about how we should sound based on how we look. A cisgender man with an unusually high voice, to take a fairly minor example, often won't be taken as seriously as a man with a deep voice. Women who speak more loudly than someone expects may be seen as bossy or difficult. There are hundreds of other examples for every gender. We all know about these expectations, and even if we aren't consciously aware of it, we will often modify our voices as a result of that knowledge.</p>

        <p>Accents carry similar problems. We're aware that sounding different than others shapes their perceptions of us, and that awareness leads to muscle activations in the throat that distort our natural voices, sometimes in subtle ways, sometimes major.</p>

        <p>Vocal fry has been something of a hot topic in recent years, and the discussion around it often has undertones of sexism and ageism. I don't have any strong opinions about vocal fry, but it's worth noting that since it is not a natural voice (it's produced by a different set of tissues than the regular vocal folds) it does not carry well in a group setting.</p>

        <p>For a variety of reasons, be they social, physical, or just bad habits, most of us wind up speaking with something other than our true, natural voice. This third exercise, “Speak With Your Voice,” is meant to help you become aware of this issue and take your first step towards finding your true voice.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>First, take one of those deep breaths we've already practiced.</li>
          <li>Next, with your mouth gently closed, hum a sliding pitch, up and down. This will sound like you're making exaggerated yummy sounds.</li>
          <li>Pay close attention to any sensations in your lips, nose, nasal passages, and teeth. You're trying to find the pitch that causes the *most* buzzing feeling.</li>
          <li>Once you find that buzzy pitch, open your mouth à la Exercise 2 and speak any sentence on that pitch. You may be surprised that this pitch pitch is quite a bit higher or lower than you think of your normal speaking voice.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

        <p>So what do I mean by "finding your true voice"? Essentially, I mean a voice that is as close to the sound that your body is built to produce naturally with the least physical effort or interference. When we can completely get rid of muscular tension, posture/alignment problems, and subconscious alterations, we'll have found our true voices.</p>

        <p>Besides being the most physically easy sound, a true voice communicates strength and confidence to others. When our vocal apparatus is relaxed, it is able to vibrate and resonate much more richly than when it is restricted by tension.</p>

        <p>It also feels good!</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, finding your true voice is a subtle and difficult challenge. People spend years working at this, and there's no way I can do anything beyond just hint at it in the space of a 30-minute talk. It may seem counterintuitive that something supposedly "natural" could take a long time to learn, but it really can be that hard to overcome bad habits. In my opinion, it's worth the effort.</p>

        <p>Sharing a sound that is ours alone enriches the world around us.</p>
