        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>This is the written version of a talk I gave at <a href="http://adorable.io">Adorable</a>. The slides I used are shown here next to what are essentially expanded speaker notes. The interactive portion of the talk doesn’t translate that well to text, but I did my best to explain the exercises. If you have questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:casey@adorable.io">reach out to me at casey@adorable.io</a> or send me <a href="http://twitter.com/basecase">a tweet</a>!</p>

        <p>Thanks for joining me! Today I want to talk about something we don’t think about that much but that affects us constantly: our voices.</p>

        <p>The first part of this talk is pretty standard; I’ll give you a little bit of background information to prepare for the second portion. After that, things will get a little weird as we actually do some vocal exercises together as a group.</p>

        <p>But first, let’s talk about the goals for this talk. I want to be clear that, though the title may suggest otherwise, this is not about public speaking or communication skills. It’s much simpler than that. I’m also not here to <em>change</em> anything about you or your voice. Quite the opposite, actually: I want to help you share your voice as it is more effectively.</p>

        <p>My starting point when putting together this talk was very simple: sometimes we are not loud enough! We’ve probably all had the experience of being in a meeting—especially one involving teleconferencing software—and we get interrupted by someone saying they can’t hear us. So I want to help you become more aware of your voice and offer your some ideas that might help you respond to that feedback in an effective way.</p>

        <p>This doesn’t apply so much as a blog post, but for the live talk I made sure to note that—since everyone has a different level of comfort with their own voice—it is totally OK to just chill out during the interactive exercises portion of the talk.</p>

        <p>In this first section, I’d like to go over some background information that I think we probably all know at some level but may not think about consciously while we’re speaking.</p>

        <p>Voices are a kind of sound, so let’s start with sound. You can think of sound as being composed of three main parts:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><em>Vibrations</em>, generated by some source and traveling through a medium (usually the air)</li>
          <li><em>Ears</em>, receiving those vibrations in the air and converting them into input that we can use</li>
          <li><em>Brains</em>, turning that input into meaningful data.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If you’re missing any of those three components, you don’t have a meaningful sound. For the physicists in the audience who now silently hate me, please not that I’m intentionally framing/abstracting things in a way that makes them useful for thinking about the voice; I realize that this is not a 100% accurate view of the universe.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row slide">
      <div class="small-12 medium-4 columns">
        <img src="img/010.png">
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>A few other tidbits about sound that we want to keep in mind while speaking:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We are by and large a visually oriented species, and so we don’t always think about the fact that sound loses fidelity much more quickly than sight. This matters especially in the case when we’re teleconferencing: get right on top of a mic and there’s no problem, but move just a few feet away and suddenly you are inaudible.</li>
          <li>Those sound vibrations are changed by the media they are traveling through. You’ve probably had the experience of hearing a recording of yourself and thinking “Who the heck is that?” Your voice sounds quite a bit different to you than it does to people outside of your own skull.</li>
          <li>We can think of the sounds we produce as directional. If you want someone to hear you, you should point yourself at them. If you look down, or off to the side, or into a computer monitor, those sound vibrations are not going to get to their ears as effectively.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row slide">
      <div class="small-12 medium-4 columns">
        <img src="img/011.png">
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>Now let’s talk more specifically about the voice. Just like with sound, we can use a reductive-but-useful formula to think about it:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><em>Air Flow</em> from your lungs it what powers the voice. No air, no voice.</li>
          <li><em>Vocal Folds</em> in your larynx, when set to oscillating by the air from your lungs, create the vibrations needed.</li>
          <li><em>Mouth Shape</em> (along with lips, nasal passages, soft palate, teeth, and other stuff) adjusts the harmonics from the vibrating vocal folds, which is how we have the ability to create different phonemes.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Again, without any of these three components, there’s no voice. And again, this is not the whole picture, but it’s a useful way of thinking about the machinery in play when you speak.</p>

        <p>We have a lot of conscious control over our voices. If we didn’t, spoken language would be impossible. However, there are also a lot of unconscious things that happen when we speak. We’ll talk about this a little bit more later on, but it’s worth mentioning here as well.</p>

        <p>Since telecommuting is such a big part of our lives, we should mention a few things specifically about microphones. When speaking with someone in the same room, we have a lot of extra information available to us that microphones do not. Since they don’t have brains, microphones are unable to fill in the blanks of a sentence when they don’t hear someone clearly. Since they don’t have eyes, they can’t watch lips, gestures, or facial expressions to interpret extra meaning. And without context of what’s happening around them, they can’t filter out things like the noise from an A/C unit or someone coughing. Our human brains are quite good at disregarding irrelevant sounds; microphones, not so much.</p>

        <p>So what’s the point of mentioning all that stuff? What I hope to do is just to get you thinking about those things while you’re speaking to a group. A little awareness goes a long way towards understanding why sometimes people can hear you and other times they can’t.</p>

        <p>Now let’s get into the fun part. When I gave this talk live, I was able to demonstrate the following exercises in front of everyone and then have them try it. Since I can’t do that here, I’ll do my best to explain exactly how to do them and why you might want to. As I mentioned in the intro, if something doesn’t make sense here, feel free to shoot me an email or a tweet!</p>

      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>We’re going to do three simple exercises. Enjoy the super snappy names I came up with for them.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row slide">
      <div class="small-12 medium-4 columns">
        <img src="img/016.png">
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>The first exercise is called “Use your lungs,” and it’s all about helping you notice your breathing process.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>First, clap your hands together above your head with your arms straight up.</li>
          <li>Second, with your arms still extended up, rotate your hands so that the backs are touching.</li>
          <li>Third, gently lower your hands until they’re resting on top of your head, still together.</li>
          <li>Lastly, from this position, take several nice, slow, deep breaths in and out.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Pay close attention to the physical sensations that come up while breathing in this position. This exercise is not about <em>making</em> anything happen, but about <em>noticing</em> how your body feels when you encourage it to use your lungs in a more generous way.</p>

        <p>Once you’ve taken several breaths, lower your arms to a neutral position and take several more deep breaths, trying to notice some of the same physical sensations in your ribcage, chest, stomach, shoulders, etc.</p>

      <div class="small-12 medium-4 columns">
        <img src="img/017.png">
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>The reason for doing this exercise is that we have a tendency to not gas up properly before speaking. Without air, remember, your voice isn’t going anywhere, so it’s really important to make sure you’ve got enough in the tank to get your voice to your listeners. Keep these extra points in mind as well: refuel when you need to, and make sure the end of your sentence gets just as much love as the beginning.</p>
